    This function plots multiple distributions of the same feature. It is e.g. useful to compare
    distribution between train and test.

    For categorical feature the plot bar is plotted, and for numeric the density plot.

        feature_distributions (list of pd.Series): List of distributions of the same feature, e.g. values of feature 'f1'
        for Train, Validation and Test.

        feature_name (Optional, str): Name of the feature plotted.

        sample_names (Optional, list of str): List of names of samples e.g. ['Train', 'Validation', 'Test'].

        plot_bw_method (Optional, float): Estimator bandwidth in density plot.

        plot_perc_outliers_removed (Optional, float): Percentage of outliers removed from each side before plotting.
